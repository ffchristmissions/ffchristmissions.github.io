teaser: "We are a collective of Christians who believe in sharing the good news of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. We believe God sent his only begotten Son into the world in the person of Jesus Christ to reconcile people back to God. <br><br>We go out onto the high street of Slough every saturday from 12:30 to 14:30 to tell people about Jesus Christ, so that they can believe in him and have a personal relationship with God."
