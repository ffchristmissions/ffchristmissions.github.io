## Educating Children in Pakistan

Every child deserves an education. In Pakistan, there are numerous families who cannot afford to send their children to school. We want to support children in their educational journey, so by partnering with a Pastor in Pakistan, we're able to provide funds to send children to school. 

> <span class="teaser">Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</span><cite>[James 1:27][1]</cite>

We'd love for this to have a longlasting impact on families for generations to come. By supporting these children, they could go onto break the cycle of poverty in their families, and even help others who need help in their communities. This could have a substantial impact on even more communities, all to the Glory of God.
